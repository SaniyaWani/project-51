        <p><b>Some information about origami:</b><br>
       Origami is the Japanese art of folding paper into decorative shapes and figures
       <i>Ori</i> meaning "folding", and <i>kami</i> meaning"paper",well <i>kami</i> changes to gami
       due to rendaku.Making paper boat without any use of glue also comes under 
       origami. Origami folders often use the Japanese word kirigami torefer to designs
       which use cuts. The small number of basic origami folds can be combined in a
       variety of ways to make intricate designs. The best-known origami model is the
       Japanese paper crane. In general, these designs begin with a square sheet of
       paper whose sides may be of different colors, prints, or patterns. Traditional
       Japanese origami, which has been practiced since the Edo period (1603â€“1867), 
       has often been less strict about these conventions, sometimes cutting the paper
       or using nonsquare shapes to start with. The principles of origami are also 
       used in stents, packaging, and other engineering applications.</p>
